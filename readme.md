#### TESTING TECHNOLOGIES TO BE USED  

```
1. Black Box Testing:

Black box testing, also known as Behavioral testing, is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is not known to the tester. These tests can be functional or non-functional, though usually functional.

2. White Box Testing:

White box testing is also known as Clear Box Testing, Open Box Testing, Glass Box Testing, Transparent Box Testing, Code-Based Testing or Structural Testing) is a software testing method in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester.

In future we can use Image recognization instead of using hetrogenious database more over High speed, accuracy and non-redundant data are the main advantages of the proposed system. In the proposed system the user is provided with a choice of data screen, which are similar in formats to the source documents. Data entry errors can be minimized through validity checks. After the verification only the data are placed the permanent database.The software can be developed further to include a lot of modules.
```

This software provides facility for reporting online crimes, complaints, missing persons, show most wanted person details mailing as well as chatting. This application is developed with scalability in mind. Additional modules can be easily added when necessary. The software is developed with modular approach. All modules in the system have been tested with valid data and invalid data and everything work successfully. Thus the system has fulfilled all the objectives identified and is able to replace the existing system.

The project will be completed successfully with the maximum satisfaction of the organization. The constraints are met and overcome successfully. The system is designed as like it was decided in the design phase. The project gives good idea on developing a full-fledged application satisfying the user requirements.

The system is very flexible and versatile. This application has a user-friendly screen that enables the user to use without any inconvenience. Validation checks induced have greatly reduced errors. Provisions have been made to upgrade the application. The application will be tested with live data and will provide a successful result..
